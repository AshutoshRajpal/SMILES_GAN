# SMILES GAN

This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implementation for generating molecular structures represented as SMILES strings.

## Features
- Tokenization of SMILES strings at the character level.
- Generator and Discriminator built using LSTM layers.
- Training loop for alternating between generator and discriminator updates.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- Numpy

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshutoshRajpal/SMILES_GAN.git
   cd SMILES_GAN
